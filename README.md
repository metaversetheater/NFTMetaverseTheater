Welcome to Metaverse Theater

About the ‘Metaverse Theater’

The Metaverse Theater is a virtual streaming service in which only the owners of certain NFTs can enter and watch limited footage. It is a Japanese cyberpunk project planned, developed, and run by the ©Metaverse Theater Management Committee.

The Metaverse Theater was born as a sub-project within the ‘Virtual Shop Conata’ to increase awareness of the Metaverse society around the world.

The Backstory of the Metaverse Theater
Due to the worldwide trend of NFT that arose in 2021, characters from Japanese anime, manga, video games are highly anticipated to be turned into an NFT.

However, understandably, some might find it difficult to truly feel that they actually own an NFT since an NFT is merely proof of the digital data to be one-and-only. The current state of a user’s experience with NFTs may not be satisfactory for the general public. How can people experience the value or the ownership of an NFT just by looking at the numerals and letters like a contract address and a unique transaction (Tx) of blockchain?

Therefore by introducing the Metaverse we aimed to improve the user experience and provide users with a more tangible feeling of owning and experiencing the value of an NFT. By producing a brand-new type of experience, we hope to contribute to the development of a future where NFTs are widespread and to speed up the implementation of blockchain in society.

A result of our ideals is the ‘The Metaverse Theater’.

A unique aspect of the Metaverse Theater is that users do not need any special devices to view it. The Metaverse Theater can easily be accessed via standard browsers such as Chrome and Safari on a computer. It is developed with Unity, which is a game engine used for the development of VR and video games.

The Proof-of-Concept Metaverse Theater Experiment and Future Possibilities

With the grand opening of the Metaverse Theater in May 2021, we opened ‘Metaverse Theater @Tohoku Zunko’ in collaboration with the Tohoku region’s support character Tohoku Zunko. This gave owners of the ‘Tohoku Zunko and Friends Special Limited Edition (https://rarible.com/zunko?tab=created )’ NFTs special entry to view a limited screening of footage from ‘Tohoku Zunko World’.

* Viewing is scheduled to end at the end of June.

Through this proof-of-concept experiment, we were able to prove that a special offer on Metaverse can be a highly versatile format of a content-specialized NFT to the fans and people in the content industry of anime, manga, games, and VTubers around the world.

Through this experiment, creators and studios can now extend their user experience further through digital ownership of NFTs in addition to the mainstream digital and visual works. NFT owners will be able to view streams and other content that is only accessible in the Metaverse Theater, offering fans a richer and more unique digital experience.

Also, the footage streaming on the Metaverse Theater is not limited to recorded footage but live streamings. Applying this structure can be used with any kind of content such as anime, manga, video games, and VTubers when selling digital data as NTFs in the future. Creators can provide special offers that include features like priority pre-screenings, sequels, side stories, director/voice cast interviews, behind-the-scenes footage, music events, live streams

■ Who is Tohoku Zunko?

Tohoku Zunko is a character with a design that is inspired by zunda-mochi, a specialty that is eaten all across the Tohoku region. Zunko's big sister Tohoku Itako represents Aomori prefecture and is based on Itako (spirit medium). Tohoku Kiritan is Zunko’s little sister and is based on the local dish Kiritanpo from Akita prefecture. Together, these characters are the 3 Tohoku Sisters and have gained considerable popularity.

Various projects based on Zunko were created in the infancy of crowdfunding and many of them quickly reached their goals. Altogether, these crowdfunding projects have raised approximately 100M Japanese yen. Many videos that can be streamed and viewed on Niconico and YouTube are made with speech software ‘VOICEROID’. A singing voice software ‘AI Tohoku Kiritan’ was also released in February 2020 with a mold-breaking natural singing voice that sent shock waves throughout the Vocaloid fanbase.

Why We Utilize ‘Dev Protocol’

The Metaverse Theater was originally first released as dApps thanks to sponsorships and resources provided by individuals and companies who supported the idea of providing a richer user experience with NFTs. In short, it was made possible due to the passion and goodwill of voluntary members.

However, this project is by no means in a financially stable position. Currently, we provide our services for free. In addition, we continue to pay for monthly running costs such as server and maintenance fees.

We are actively focusing our resources on the OEM sales of the Metaverse Theater system to interested companies. However, through detailed talks with potential clients, we found that utilizing the Metaverse with the selling of NFT is still unfeasible for the majority of companies.
In addition, OEM projects rely heavily on customization to the client’s needs. Therefore, the project itself may stray from our main goal of providing the Metaverse Theater to the general public.

Therefore, in order to sustain our Metaverse Theater project activities, we started utilizing ‘Dev Protocol’. Of course, we will continue with our attempt to monetize the Theatre through OEM projects.

How the DEV Collected Funding Will be Used

The funds we collect on DEV will be used for 1. Retaining resources, 2. Legal affairs and accounting, and lastly, 3. Development for the Metaverse Theater. The Metaverse Theater is a new service in the early stage. It still has many factors that need to be improved to provide a better experience for users. While considering plans to scale, we will continue to work on the functions and features of the Theatre.

■ Planned Features for the Metaverse Theatre
・Creation of demonstration pages.
・Disconnecting Twitter to simplify the sign-up process.
・Enabling Polygon chain.
・Enabling original domains (for companies and paying users).
・Improving in-theater and external user experience (Seat views, entrance development).
The implementation period for each feature has not been set at the moment, and the additional developments will be brought into discussion depending on the amount of support we receive.

Co-creation of a Virtual Culture
The Metaverse Theater is a project made together with fans that allow users to cross the line between reality and unreality.

To put it simply, it is not just a service. It is an entertainment project that is created together with users. As a last note, we will leave you with a Japanese saying that is roughly translated as “Don’t just watch the party. Since you’re here, come join in”. Please consider joining us in making the Metaverse Theater a better place and become the catalyst to spreading NFTs around the world.

We look forward to your continuous support.
